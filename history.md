# A Quick Look into Computation Models and Scala's Inception

### 1936 - Alonzo Church Develops Lambda Calculus (λ-Calculus) & Alan Turing Develops a Turing Machine.
	
	> λ-calculus was developed as a formal way to express algorithmic solutions to problems.  Most notably λ-calculus was used as a complementary theory to Alan Turing's Turing machine's.  Both were used heavily to forward the area of computability theory.

### 1939 J.B Rosser Develops Recursive Functions

	>  Asserts that Church's λ-calculus and Turing's Turing machine, as well as a third model - recursive function have equivalent expressive power.  In other words, if a problem can be solved using the Turing machine or λ-calculus, it can also be solved using recursive functions.

### Martin Odersky Develops Scala

	>  I realize I'm skipping a lot of stuff between 1939 and 1991, when Scala was developed.  I just want to get to showing you how cool Scala is.  Odersky, a German doctoral student submits his dissertation, "A New Approach to Formal Language Definition and its Applications to Oberon."  This research introduces calculus on derivation trees which later lends itself to the creation of the language we all know today called Scala.
